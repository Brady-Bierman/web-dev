                <div id="Deadlock" alt="deadlock title screen"></div>

                <p>Overall the game is quite fun and the devs are very keen to see it continue to grow and progress with more major updates bringin new features, monsters, and more scheduled for the future. Some people on PC have seen some issues with the game but the devs are also patching those as they come up quite quickly. So I highly recommend getting Monster Hunter Wilds today.</p>


                <p>The game itself is a 3rd person shooter-moba that is 6v6 with (currently) 3 lanes each with 2 players from each team fighting to push into the enemy's base. To win the game you have to kill the enemy's Patron in their base. To get to the base, you need to push a lane all the way up to it and in the process kill the first Guardian, then the Walker, then the Base Guards, then kill both of the Shrines, at this point the Patron becomes damageable and you can break its first health bar, then it transforms into its “vulnerable state” and you can then kill it for good and win the game. Like most mobas you start out weak and gain “levels” and money as you play each new match starting at “level 1” with no money. I say “level” because as of right now there is no actual level system, as you gain money from kills it fills a bar that when full gives you a skill point to upgrade your abilities with. Spending money doesn't decrease your point progression so you are free to spend at any time to try to get an advantage over your opponents. Each lane has waves of minions that are spawned to help the players push, they also give money when killed. The way money is gotten from the minions is you get a portion for a minion dieing, and then a soul leaves the minion's body, if someone shoots it they get the money, if it doesn't get shot then the team that killed the minion auto gets the money. This means that when players are fighting over the lane, they can try to snipe each others money and potentially get ahead in the money portion of the game. This can lead to them getting more items and upgrading more skills which in turn makes it easier to bully the enemy into losing more money, thus potentially causing a snowball if the enemy isn't careful and adapts their strats. In between the lanes are camps that give money to the player that kills them thus allowing for people who get behind to potentially catch up, or those that are ahead to get even more ahead if the enemy isn't careful. In the middle of the whole map is something called mid-boss, when the mid-boss is killed it spawns an item called the rejuvenator(or rejuv as the characters refer to it in game) which when claimed gives a powerful buff to the team that claimed it and cuts the next respawn timer in half. This means the rejuv holders can push hard and be harder to kill and come back far faster than the defenders. This exists to help prevent players that hid under towers or some such from stalling the game too hard and makes both teams have to keep track of what the other is doing. The fact that the rejuv also needs to be claimed after the kill gives tons of counter play options, many a time I've been on the losing team only for someone on the team to manage to sneakily steal the rejuv which lead to us winning, or for us to hold out longer to try to turn it around at least. </p>


                <p>A fun mechanic that Deadlock has is the parry/melee system. Basically you can press a button to light melee or hold it to make a charged melee which hits harder. The player being meleed can push another button to “parry/block” the melee and stun the attacker, the parry has a cool down on it after it is used whether it actually did anything or not. This gives tons of interesting interactions when players get in close with each other and helps to prevent players from staring at each other as they angrily reload at each other hoping to be the one to finish first.</p>


                <p>All in all I have enjoyed the game for the most part. The main thing to remember when playing though is that the game is far from finished even though it really feels finished with how well done it is even now. In just the several months I've played it, they have released 8 heroes into the tester game mode which have basically as in development characters as you can get, some don't even have animations and are reusing already existing assets as placeholders just like you would expect to see in internal playtests; the map has seen several major overhauls, with the most recent being them removing a whole lane and thus reworking the map to work for 3 lanes instead of the original 4; some items have had major changes in the shop; some characters have even had large adjustments made to core parts of their kits. This is because this game is still effectively in the stage that most companies would keep out of the public eye. So if you do try the game remember that, you are effectively watching the devs build the game around you in real time in a way that only people under NDAs would normally see. So if you are fine with a game still under construction, then go ahead and give Deadlock a try.</p>
