                <h2>Beat Saber</h2>

                <p>Beat Saber is a VR game which is centered around using essentially lightsabers to hit boxes flying through the air in time to the song being played. While you can set many different modifiers to change how the game is played, by default the game has arrows showing how you must slash the box or “beat” to get the points for it. You can set the difficulty of the song from easy to medium to hard to expert, and on some songs extreme. They denote how many beats there are and how hard the movements are to hit them all in the time allowed. On higher difficulties, your movement is very controlled because if you make the wrong move as you slash a beat you won't be able to get your blade in the right position for the next beat. Believe me the beats get very fast and close together at the highest difficulties. If you miss a beat it breaks your combo which hurts your score and if you miss enough beats this will cause you to fail the song. The goal is to get the best combo you can as you play each song to get the highest score.</p>

                <p>Overall the game is quite fun and good exercise since you have to be constantly moving during most songs and especially the higher difficulties are just a barrage of beats flying at you requiring non-stop fast movements. I highly recommend playing Beat Saber if you own VR.</p>
