                <h2>Balatro</h2>

                <p>Balatro is a deck building roguelike game which means you start with a standard deck of cards and then play through randomly generated encounters getting various items and cards along the way to improve your deck, and fight using those cards to progress. Balatro is based loosely on poker and normal playing cards. I say loosely because while it uses standard playing cards as a base and uses terms and hands from poker as the basis of points, it very heavily departs from them during actual gameplay. The basic idea is that you start with a standard 52 card deck(you also unlock variations of decks that have various starting bonuses to make for different styles of play like having more starting money, more discards, starting with powerful item effects already given to you, etc), then you progress through 3 “rounds” (encounters) per “ante” (set of three rounds), each encounter you have a minimum score to beat by playing poker hands to combo off of the cards and effects you have gathered on the run, the ultimate goal is to beat 8 antes. Each ante ups the minimum score of each of the encounters as you progress making it harder and harder to keep going.</p>

                <p>How do you gain points? Well you get a minimum amount of points just for playing a hand, like getting 40 points(called chips since its poker themed) and 3 mult or multiplier for a flush. Each card then scores points based on what it is: faces are worth 10, ace is worth 11, 9 is worth 9, 8 is worth 8, etc. You can increase any of the values, and gain more mult by gaining jokers. Jokers are the main part of the game: if you get good jokers from the random shops then you can win, if you get bad ones or just ones that don't combo together well, then you will lose. After you beat an encounter you get money as a reward which you can then spend at the shop. The shop can have card packs which contain random cards based on what the pack is, i.e. playing cards, jokers, tarot cards, spectral cards, or planet cards. It also has some loose cards randomly picked that you can buy if you want. Finally it has “vouchers” which majorly influence the flow of the game like making it so that you get more money at the end of rounds or making shops cheaper or making certain types of cards more likely to show up in the shop.</p>

                <p>I mentioned tarot cards, spectral cards, and planet cards earlier: tarot cards are cards that can affect you deck or jokers to improve them like making it so that on top of the normal effects a joker gives, it now also gives more mult to each hand played, or makes it so that a card is worth more points or multi when played, or change a card to be a different value or suit, to name a few. Planet cards increase the starting value of a hand so for example the 40 points and 3 mult of a flush could be increased to 6 points and 5 mult with the right planet card. Spectral cards are the truly wild cards that can very heavily influence a run like a card that changes the suits of all cards the game randomly picks to a random suit or the same thing but with value, another one gives you a second copy of a joker you own but destroys the rest of your jokers, etc. </p>

                <p>Overall I really enjoy the game and have fun when I open it every so often to play a couple of runs. I would very much recommend this game if you like deck builders or roguelikes.</p>
