                <h2>Destiny 2</h2>

                <p>D2 is the sequel and continuation of Destiny and the franchise is now over 10 years old at this point with D1 still running to this day even if it hasn't gotten any new updates in about 7 years. Destiny is a looter-shooter MMORPG-like game, which means the core gameplay of the game revolves around using guns, classes/subclasses, and looting gear from enemies. Destiny combines aspects of both fantasy and sci-fi into a unique universe. I will be focusing on D2 as that is the current game that is being updated and played by most, though a few die-hard fans still play D1.</p>


                <p>The basic (and I do mean very basic since it has a ton of lore spanning literal millions of years) overview of Destiny story as a whole is that you are a Guardian, a person resurrected by a small robot called a Ghost. Your job is to protect the Last City and its interests across the solar system. I am getting a little ahead of myself though, allow me to give some more context. In the year 2014 (the release date of the actual first game) an object the size of a small moon was spotted entering our solar system. It traveled from planet to moon to planetoid, terraforming each one it visited to be more supportive of life. Eventually humans sent a group of astronauts to mars to meet it there when it arrived. After making contact with the sphere, they found it to be non-hostile. This sphere was what humanity would come to call the Traveler. From the Traveler humanity learned much (as far as I know the Traveler never actually talked to anyone and the lore on HOW we learned what we learned from it doesn't really say much just that we did learn from it) and human lifespans tripled, we developed the ability to travel across the solar system in hours or minutes instead of years, we learned to create settlements and colonies on every place the Traveler had been. This was the Golden Age but then the Traveler's enemies caught up to it and attacked. They would have destroyed humanity if the Traveler had not decided to hold its ground instead of fleeing like it had in the past when attacked and with the help of an unlikely “ally” (and I use that term VERY loosely considering what I know of the individual in question) who helped to confuse and misdirect the enemy. The Traveler went dormant after the confrontation (which helped to throw its pursuers off since they were tracking it by a specific signature which its dormant state doesn't give off) but as it did it created the Ghosts to help protect it and humanity. These Light-Bearers (any who wield the power of the Traveler as some took their power and used it for evil instead of to help) would eventually gather together and with the help of the last of humanity built the Last City in the shadow of the traveler on earth. This should tell you how few survived as we went from having at least a small colony on almost every moon and planet and even an unknown number of space stations and hordes of satellites all over the system, to a city probably 10 miles across(the size is never specified in game and this is just a rough guess on my part), if that, plus some small scattered villages and such across the earth.</p>

                <p>You can make up to three characters which you can choose from the title screen menu. These are kind of like separate saves of the game even if you can transfer gear between them via your storage vault which is account wide. Each character picks a class to be either Hunter, Warlock, or Titan. The Hunter is your typical quick and nimble scout/rogue from most fantasy games and features many acrobatic feats and roguish styles of play. They excel in dealing damage, stealthing/slinking around, gunslinging and more. The Warlock is more of the stereotypical caster (ie wizard/sorcerer/etc). Don't get me wrong, all three classes cast various abilities and such but just like how the Hunter leans into gunplay, the Warlock leans into its abilities the most. They have many ways to combo abilities and recharge them faster from just doing the things they would be doing anyway, they also have the most ability to support/heal their teammates out of  the three, in addition they also are the only class that specializes in summoning things (mostly turrets that float around the caster but also some deployable critters too). The Titan is the tank, an unstoppable force and immovable object both. They have the tools to sustain themselves in an extended fight and boast high durability. With abilities that lean into surviving and even some taunts to draw attention, they are the tip of the spear and the wall to hide behind depending on what they need. I will now admit that I am a Titan main through and through and that I have limited experience with playing the other. So take my thoughts on them with a grain of salt as last year showed when Titans(myself included) complained VERY loudly at only getting melee abilities and nothing but melee with little else towards the other parts of the Titan fantasy: ie while we love to punch things into next year, we mainly like to be tanky and in the face of our foes, punching is just a natural part of that playstyle not the end all be all, sometimes what others think is a class's main tenets are wrong. Also worth noting that each class can do some of the things the others can do, it's just that each has something they are better at than the others. Each of the classes have 6 subclasses which are each themed around an element in the game and use aspects of that element to do what the class likes to do. There is the Solar(fire) subclass which usually features ways to burn/explode enemies and heal/renew yourself or others. Arc(lightning) which is all about speed, power, go-go-go, kill fast,etc. Void(nothing I can really put here other than “eldridge magic”) which has ways to devour the lifeforce of enemies to heal you, make overshilds, make you invisible, and more besides. Strand (pull on the fibers of reality and the collective consciousness and weave them into something new) summon threadlings (small worms woven of strand matter that seek out enemies to explode on) tear your foes from the collective and make the vulnerable, sever enemies from existence. Stasis (ice) centers around slowing enemies with bone chilling cold, freezing them solid and shattering them into dust, and cloaking yourself in ice to dampen their blows.</p>


                <p>There are also tons of different guns including smgs, shotguns, snipers, rocket launchers, lmgs, and more. Between the different guns and their archetypes (like slow firing bolt action sniper or relatively quick semi-auto sniper and more inbetween), there are dozens of different styles of guns to use and there's a style of play for everyone.</p>


                <p>The current story in the game has us going back and dealing with an old foe that we killed once before(magic released from another foe has essentially resurrected an echo of their soul on accident) and we are learning all sorts of things about their past as we deal with this latest incarnation of him. Overall the story has been well received by the player base, this combined with the various promises of some of the future updates and what the devs are doing have people looking to the future with some hope.</p>


                <p>However, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that things are not going well for the company behind Destiny (Bungie) between mismanagement and scandals from executives, terrible overspending and mismanagement of funds, Bungie missing its revenue goals by about 45%, large layoffs, subpar story from other seasons and the expansion before the current one, the last two seasons having horrible bugs including some players being essentially locked out of playing the new seasonal game modes due to a glitch for over half of the season, a mobile spinoff of the game have more of the features that players have asked for for years than the original game has ever implemented, the 10 year saga being wrapped up in a neat little bow in the latest expansion leading to many players feeling like they are done with Destiny's universe now that they had this resolution, and more issues besides over the last several years. It is because of all of this that I can't really recommend this game at this time, as much as it pains me to say. I love this game and its lore, the story and the characters and just the overall gameplay are great most of the time. Bungie just has a problem of doing something great and then instantly shooting itself in the foot with a dumb decision. Honestly if I weren't so invested in the universe as a whole I would have jumped ship a long time ago. So until Bungie can show that they can right this sinking titanic, I will advise people to watch from afar for now.</p>
