                <h2>Videogame Reviews</h2>

                <p>Welcome to my video game reviews, here I will rate various games I have played. I will give some background about a game such as the lore and some things about the gameplay of it. I will then give my thoughts on how much I liked the game and whether I recommend the game to others. Go ahead and select which game you would like to read about from the navigation bar at the top.</p>
