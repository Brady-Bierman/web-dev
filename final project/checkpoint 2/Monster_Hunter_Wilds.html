                <h2>Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>

                <p>MH Wilds is the latest Monster Hunter game to be released, in fact it was released just over a week ago as of the writing of this. As the name implies the game is all about hunting monsters, you then take materials from said monsters and craft armor and weapons to make you stronger to then go back out and fight bigger badder things. MH Wilds is considered by the playerbase to be MH World's spiritual successor/sequel. The game features a decently long story for the journey to the end game that I honestly enjoyed a lot. MH has never been known for its stories but this was actually interesting with some depth and true character growth. As the game is still relatively new I won't go into too much detail on the story as of right now for spoilers. I will mainly talk about the actual gameplay of the game, at least as much as I have experienced as I have only really just gotten into the open post story end game recently. I am relatively new to the franchise of MH with my only other experience being MH World. I have also only played charge blade and gunlance with some dabbling of hunting horn and bow in the practice area. </p>


                <p>MH has 14 weapons that the player can choose from, each with unique approaches to how you fight. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Charge Blade</li>

                    <li>Lance</li>

                    <li>Gunlance</li>

                    <li>Bow</li>

                    <li>Heavy Bowgun</li>

                    <li>Light Bowgun</li>

                    <li>Switchaxe</li>

                    <li>Dual Blades</li>

                    <li>Greatsword</li>

                    <li>Sword and Shield</li>

                    <li>Longsword</li>

                    <li>Hunting Horn</li>

                    <li>Hammer</li>

                    <li>Insect Glaive</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each weapon has its own way to go about playing the game: like how despite both bowguns being all about ranged attacks, heavy is more about being slow but powerful and often has ways of facing the monster directly like having a shield mounted on the front where as light is all about unleashing barrages of bullets as you rapidly run around the monster like an annoying gnat. Charge Blade is all about using its sword and shield mode to stab the monster and charge up energy which it the banks to create charges it then morphs into big axe mode to spend, giving the weapon a dual nature of being both one of the big slow weapons and one of the fast weapons with lots of cool animations that use “guard points”(basically if you can time it so that the monster hits you during certain animations it gets auto blocked rewarding the knowledge of both how your weapon works and knowing how the monster moves to get the timing right). Hammer is just straight bonk the monster until it gets knocked loopy and falls over. Insect Glaive is all about using your kinsect (pet giant bug) to attack the monster to gain buffs to then spend them doing cool attacks. Dual Blades are just the classic whirlwind of blades “death by a thousand cuts” style of fast short swords.</p>


                <p>The gameplay is quite fast paced with its own unique difficulties. Like Souls games, a big part of the game is dodge rolling to avoid damage from enemies. Also each monster is basically a boss fight all its own. When you push a button to make an attack or do anything with your weapon like block or reload, you get locked into an animation to do that action. This animation lock is a major part of the balancing of the weapons since getting locked into an animation can cause you to get killed. You also can't use items with your weapon out, so you have to sheath to heal or cleanse a debuff. The main idea behind this style of play is that you have to be able to read the monster, like a hunter reads/anticipates the actions of their prey, and act accordingly. Is the monster doing an animation that will cause it to stay still for a while? Well then you might try to get off a long animation combo for big damage. Is the monster doing a bunch of quick strikes all around? Then you might want to not attack at all and just focus on dodging or holding onto block for dear life. This means that the player has to know and understand the tells of the game in general (like the way the game tells you the BIG ultimate attack of a monster is coming by zooming way out as the monster prepares to do the thing) as well as monster specific tells (like some monsters might flight high before dive bombing you into the ground, or you see a giant build up of energy that just screams “I'M A FIRIN MA LAASSAAARR!  BWWWWAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!”). Some attacks are super telegraphed, like Agnaktor always clicking its beak before it fires its laser breath in the well known “clack clack BBZZZZZZZZZ” and some are subtle like a monster shifting its weight as it prepares to swing one of its limbs at you. All of this tells you what the monster is about to do and you then act accordingly by choosing to do an attack or just dodging or blocking, and if you get it wrong then you get hit, or with the power of the ultimate attacks, you might just get killed. Each hunt has a maximum of 3 “faints” (getting killed/ having your health go to 0) which are shared among the players in the hunt. So one player can cause the hunt to fail if they aren't careful and die 3 times. If you are playing in multiplayer you really don't want to be the one to “cart” (when you are dropped to 0 health your character then gets teleported to the base camp and an animation of you being brought in on a cart and then healed plays hence most players calling it “carting”) and potentially cause everyone to fail.</p>


                <p>Overall the game is quite fun and the devs are very keen to see it continue to grow and progress with more major updates bringin new features, monsters, and more scheduled for the future. Some people on PC have seen some issues with the game but the devs are also patching those as they come up quite quickly. So I highly recommend getting Monster Hunter Wilds today.</p>
